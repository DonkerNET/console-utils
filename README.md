# ConsoleUtils
A library written in C# with the purpose to make building console applications a little easier.

## About

The library currently contains the following functionality.

### CommandExecution

Allows you to read input from the console and route these to specific methods, similar to attribute routing in ASP.NET MVC5. You can setup controllers with methods where you can specify routes using attributes.

### ConsoleEx

Contains extra methods that the _Console_ class misses. For example, you can write a single line in a different color, allow the user to input passwords without displaying them or output text using paging.

## Examples

The library is simple to use and there is a separate project in the solution that contains many examples (with commentary) on how to use it.
